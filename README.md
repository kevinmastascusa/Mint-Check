# Mint-Check
Mint Check is an open‐source trading card grader that uses image processing to assess centering, corners, edges, and surface condition. It quickly computes a 1–10 grade for collectors and enthusiasts. Prototype-level—designed for research, not a substitute for professional grading services.
