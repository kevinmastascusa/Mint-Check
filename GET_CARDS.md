# Getting Pokémon Card Pictures

There are several ways to obtain Pokémon card images:

1. **Scan or Photograph**  
   - Use a scanner or a digital camera/smartphone to capture images of your physical cards.
   - Ensure the images are taken in good lighting, from a top-down perspective.

2. **Online Sources**  
   - Search for publicly-available or licensed images on official Pokémon sites or fan sites.
   - Use image search engines, but verify usage rights and copyright before use.

3. **Synthetic Images**  
   - Run the provided `generate_test_images.py` script to create synthetic card images for testing:
     ```sh
     python /c:/Users/dlaev/mintcheck/generate_test_images.py
     ```

Choose the option that best fits your needs and legal requirements.
